# rubik-reader-by-two-3d-image
This project can read Rubik's cube state by 2 inclined images of each half.
First, colors calibrate by "train" code. Then, Rubik's cube images convert to the status matrix by "Rubik's cube reader" code.
To see the performance, run    /Rubik's cube reader/Run_Me.m 
This project is written as "Digital Image Processing" course final project.
